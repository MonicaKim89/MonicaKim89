## 🧠 Independent Research

Developing AI-based stress and emotional assessment models using digital communication data.

- Integration of conversational text and behavioral signals (response latency, editing patterns, interaction dynamics)  
- Generative AI–based data augmentation for counseling dialogue expansion  
- Transfer learning–enhanced Korean emotional prediction models  
- Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME) for indicator extraction and interpretability  
- Statistical validation against standardized psychological scales (e.g., PSS, DASS-21)  

This research strengthens quantitative evaluation frameworks within human-centered AI systems.
